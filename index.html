                <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
                <p>Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort. There are many small,
                    family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.</p>
